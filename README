routr -- lightweight request routing for WebOb
==============================================

Just a small example::

  from routr import route, GET, POST
  from routr.schema import form, String

  routes = route("/users",
    route(POST, "/",          "views.create_user", guards=[form(username=String)]),
    route(GET,  "/{id:int}",  "views.get_user"))
