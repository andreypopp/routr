0.3.2
-----

* ``routr.static.static`` routes now can be distinguished via ``static_view``
  annotation instead of view attribute (still here for backward compatibility)

0.3.1
-----

* fix ``routr.static`` behaviour

0.3
---

* get rid of ``Configuration``, now ``route`` is just a plain function -- this
  allows better composability w/o requirement to share configuration object
  between different parts of the app

* add ``routr.static`` for serving static files

* add ``routr.utils.positional_args`` for introspection of positional arguments
  of different types of objects and ``routr.utils.inject_args`` for injecting
  positional arguments based on introspection

0.2.1
-----

* bugfixes to DSL

0.2
---

* [not backward compatible] new DSL -- got rid of guards keyword argument which
  is too noisy

0.1.7
-----

* [bugfix] incorrect reversal of urls with more than one param

0.1.6
-----

* [bugfix] fix bug with RouteGuarded poped up in RouteGroup match

* add '_' to allowed args in URLPattern

0.1.5
-----

* introduced RequestParams.exception_factory which abstracts away
  HTTPBadRequest raise in case of invalid data being supplied

* [bugfix] RouteGuarded.response now installed correctly, previously it
  sometimes contained NoUrlMatched objects which are not responses

0.1.4
-----

* RequestParams.post_processor now also can be accumulated via addition

* fix bug in RequestParams which prevented Option wrap SchemaNode objects
  directly

0.1.3
-----

* fix broken 0.1.2 release by including CHANGES file in dist

0.1.2
-----

* trace factory made configurable via Configuration.trace attribute

* method and PATH_INFO extraction delegated to configuration, allows
  implementing routing for other request wrapper (werkzeug or django's request
  for example)

* routes now have access to configuration object via ``cfg`` attribute

0.1.1
-----

* allow guards return None (routing doesn't break on this and proceed with old
  trace)

* RequestParams now can accept colander.SchemaNode directly (allows to supply
  validators)

0.1
---

* initial release
