important
---------

  * add support for routr.schema.QueryParams

  * a way to pass request to view

    sometimes we want view to get request as an argument, we can still process
    args and kwargs but somehow decorate request and pass it to view

  * improve test suite

  * more explanatory error messages

  * add docs!

  * URLPattern placeholders to be optionally labeled

    see as an example

      /api/news/{id:int}/

    that should only be rendered by .. autoroutr as

      /api/news/{id}/

    but should be functionally equivalent to

      /api/news/{int}/

less important
--------------

  * URLPattern to produce kwargs

    what about

      /api/news/{id:int}/

    to return {'id': ...} as kwargs to view? Probably bad idea because url
    should be considered as which contains only required params

  * optional docstrings for routes

    for now, we can pull docs from view's docstring, but it may be desirable to
    put different docstring for specific route.

  * introspection for guards or just make them able to generate documentation

  * expand URL reversal for unnamed routes (by view)

    sometimes it's just not possible, because we can define view as lambda or
    something
