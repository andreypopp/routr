---------

  * add support for routr.schema.QueryParams doc generation

  * improve test suite

  * more explanatory error messages

  * URLPattern to produce kwargs

    what about

      /api/news/{id:int}/

    to return {'id': ...} as kwargs to view? Probably bad idea because url
    should be considered as which contains only required params

  * optional docstrings for routes

    for now, we can pull docs from view's docstring, but it may be desirable to
    put different docstring for specific route.

  * introspection for guards or just make them able to generate documentation

  * expand URL reversal for unnamed routes (by view)

    sometimes it's just not possible, because we can define view as lambda or
    something
